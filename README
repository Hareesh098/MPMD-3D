## Instructions to Use MPMD-3D

### Step 1: Build the Project
In the main directory, run the following command:
```
$ make clean; make
```

**Note**: The GSL scientific library is required because the Langevin thermostat uses the GSL random number generator. 
Please ensure GSL is installed before proceeding.

### Step 2: Prepare the STATE File
There is a `STATE` file containing the initial position coordinates and velocities. This file can be either an initial 
lattice or a restart file.

### Step 3: Run the Simulation
To run the simulation, execute:
```
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib 
$ nohup ./main <prefix> &
```

### Step 4: Output Files
The following output files will be generated in the `OUT` directory:
- `<prefix>.RESULT`
- `<prefix>.INPUT`
- `<prefix>.TRAJECTORY`
- `<prefix>.STATE`

### Modifying the Frictional Drag Coefficient
If you need to change the frictional drag coefficient (equivalent to changing gas pressure), modify the value of `nu` in 
the subroutine `Leapfrog.c`. Recompile the code before running it again.

### Performance Suggestion
The current code is limited to small system sizes (up to a few thousand particles) due to the expensive error function 
calculation required for Ewald sums and the absence of a cutoff. For better performance, consider converting the 2D code 
into a 3D version and using a suitable cutoff. Implementing linked lists, neighbor lists, or a combination of both will 
significantly improve performance.
